# Using Collections in Console

This guide walks you through managing collections using the [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai) interface.

## Creating a new collection

Navigate to the **Collections** tab in the [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai). Make sure you are in the correct team.

Click on "Create new collection" to create a new `collection`.

You can choose to enable generate embeddings on document upload or not. We recommend leaving the generate embeddings setting to on.

## Viewing and editing collection configuration

You can view and edit the Collection's configuration by clicking on Edit Collection.

This opens up the following modal where you can view the configuration and make changes.

## Adding a document to the collection

Once you have created the new `collection`, you can click on it in the collections table to view the `documents` included in the `collection`.

Click on "Upload document" to upload a new `document`.

Once the upload has completed, each document is given a File ID. You can view the File ID, Collection ID and hash of the `document` by clicking on the `document` in the documents table.

## Deleting documents and collections

You can delete `documents` and `collections` by clicking on the more button on the right side of the collections or documents table.
