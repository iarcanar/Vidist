# Using Collections

Collections enable you to upload, store, and semantically search through your documents. Whether you're building a RAG application or need to search across large document sets, Collections provides the infrastructure to manage and query your content.

For an overview of what Collections is, please see [Collections](../key-information/collections).

You can upload a maximum of 100,000 files per collection.

**Looking for Files?** If you want to attach files directly to chat messages for conversation context, see [Files](/docs/guides/files). Collections are different—they provide persistent document storage with semantic search across many documents.

## What You Can Do

With Collections, you can:

* **Create collections** to organize your documents
* **Upload documents** in various formats (HTML, PDF, text, etc.)
