        '🚀 MAJOR v3.0.0 - Gemini imgbb Upload Revolution (ULTIMATE FIX: Gemini images now permanently stored via imgbb upload - User Suggestion: "ฉันมีไอเดีย อัพโหลดภาพที่สร้างเสร็จขึ้นไปที่ imgbb เลยเพื่อเก็บประวัติ" (Upload completed images to imgbb to save history); Problem Recap: v2.12.18 fixed thumbnail display ✅, v2.12.19 stripped redundant url (50% reduction) ✅, v2.12.20 never clears entirely ✅, BUT Gemini base64 still too large (200-500KB per image), localStorage quota (5-10MB) fundamentally insufficient, emergency cleanup still fails, data lost on refresh; Why imgbb is BETTER than IndexedDB: Unlimited storage (vs 50-100MB limit), permanent URLs (vs browser-specific), cross-device compatible, simpler implementation (1 function call vs 5 phases/200+ lines), already integrated (uploadImageToImgbb exists), tiny localStorage footprint (URL=40 bytes vs base64=200KB); Implementation Phase 1 (Line 7790): Upload edited image to imgbb after generation completes, update history item with permanent imgbbUrl, save to localStorage with tiny URL instead of huge base64, graceful fallback if upload fails (keeps base64); Phase 2 (Line 7737-7785): DELETED 50+ lines of emergency cleanup code - no longer needed with imgbb URLs; Phase 3 (Line 10264-10266): Updated rendering to prefer imgbbUrl first (permanent) > url > initialImage (base64) > cachedUrl; Benefits: NO quota errors ever, permanent storage (images hosted on imgbb), tiny localStorage (40 bytes URL vs 200KB base64), can store 1000+ Gemini edits, fast rendering (imgbb CDN), graceful fallback (works offline with base64), simple codebase (removed complexity); Results: Console shows "📤 Uploading Gemini image to imgbb..." → "✅ Gemini image uploaded: https://i.ibb.co/..." → "💾 Gemini history saved with imgbb URL (no quota issues!)", thumbnails persist after F5 forever, localStorage stays small, cross-device URL sharing possible; Tradeoff: Requires network for upload but acceptable for history feature)',
        '🚨 Never Clear History Fix v2.12.20 (CRITICAL FIX: refreshHistory() no longer clears all history on quota exceeded - User Report: "หลังกด Reload History ภาพหายทั้งหมด!" + "Emergency cleanup: FAILED"; Console Evidence: "⚠️ localStorage quota exceeded during refresh → ❌ Still quota error after cleanup - clearing history entirely 💀"; Root Cause Issue 1: Gemini emergency cleanup (line 7752-7767) FAILED because even after removing old Gemini, Grok videos + latest Gemini (200KB) still exceeds quota; Root Cause Issue 2: refreshHistory() aggressive cleanup (line 9488-9500) did NOT strip url from Gemini, still had 400KB duplicates, then CLEARED ENTIRE HISTORY as last resort (disaster!); Solution Fix 1 (refreshHistory): Strip redundant url from Gemini before aggressive cleanup (50% reduction), NEVER clear entirely - instead use multi-level fallback: 1) Remove Gemini → 2) Keep Grok + Wavespeed → 3) Keep only Grok; Fix 2 (Gemini emergency): Strip url from Wavespeed items too, add second fallback to keep only Grok + current Gemini if still too large; Implementation: Line 9488-9521 strip Gemini url + 3-level fallback; Line 7752-7781 enhanced emergency cleanup with Wavespeed url stripping + Grok-only fallback; Results: Grok videos NEVER lost even on extreme quota, Gemini latest preserved when possible, old items removed intelligently (Gemini first → Wavespeed → keep Grok), NO MORE "clearing history entirely" disaster; Console shows proper progression: "🛡️ EMERGENCY: Kept X Grok + Y Wavespeed" or "🚨 CRITICAL: Kept only Grok videos")',
        '💾 Gemini Storage Quota Fix v2.12.19 (CRITICAL FIX: Gemini image edits now persist after page refresh - User Report: "ยังคงปัญหาเดิม" after v2.12.18; Console Evidence: "ℹ️ Could not save videoHistory - data too large, skipping silently"; Root Cause: v2.12.18 fixed thumbnail display BUT localStorage save FAILS due to quota exceeded; Gemini stores same base64 image in BOTH url AND initialImage (400-1000KB per edit!); Even after aggressive cleanup still too large; Data exists only in memory, lost on refresh; Solution Phase 1: Strip redundant url field before saving - rendering prefers initialImage anyway, url unnecessary for Gemini (50% size reduction per item!); Phase 2: Fix auto-cleanup validation - added hasValidImage check to preserve Gemini items with initialImage but no url; Previously auto-cleanup would delete Gemini items after removing url field; Phase 4: Emergency fallback - if still too large after stripping url, remove ALL old Gemini items, keep only current Gemini + all Grok + 5 others; Implementation: Line 7736 added url stripping map + emergency cleanup; Line 8750 added hasValidImage validation; Results: Gemini edits now save successfully, thumbnails persist after F5, no quota errors for normal usage (3-5 edits), works with both Gemini and WAN 2.6; Complete fix for entire image edit persistence issue)',
        '🖼️ Gemini Image Edit Thumbnail Fix v2.12.18 (CRITICAL BUGFIX: Fixed Gemini edited images showing ORIGINAL image in history instead of edited image - User Report: "ภาพที่สร้างเสร็จ แสดงผลบนตำแหน่ง upload field ได้ถูกต้อง แต่ในส่วน history panel กลับแสดงค้างเป็น generate และเมื่อ reload ด้วยตัวเอง พบว่าแสดงเป็นภาพเริ่มต้นก่อนตกแต่ง แทน"; Investigation: Checked old GitHub versions (v2.11.1 before Grok) to understand original image edit system; Found TWO separate handlers: handleImageEditComplete (WAN 2.6) vs handleImageEditCompleteGemini (Gemini); Root Cause: Line 7731 in Gemini flow creates placeholder with initialImage:imageBase64Data (ORIGINAL image) but history rendering logic at line 10210 prefers initialImage over url, so displays original instead of edited; WAN 2.6 correctly UPDATES initialImage from original to edited in handleImageEditComplete (v2.12.15 fix), but Gemini never updates placeholder; Fix: Changed line 7731 from "initialImage: imageBase64Data" (original) to "initialImage: fullBase64" (edited image); Now thumbnail shows edited image immediately; No code changes to rendering logic needed - just fixed data source; Single-line fix resolves entire issue)',
        '🖼️ Image Edit Thumbnail Update Fix v2.12.15 (CRITICAL BUGFIX: Fixed thumbnail staying as "generating" after image edit completes - User Report: "thumbnail บน history panel ยังเป็น generating ไม่อัพเดตภาพที่สร้างเสร็จ"; Problem: After Wan 2.6 image edit completes, thumbnail in history panel shows spinner overlay and PROCESSING status instead of edited image; Investigation: 5 potential root causes - placeholderIndex=-1 causing silent update failure, race condition in renderVideoHistory(), status not updating to completed, localStorage save failure, refreshHistory() overwriting edited image with original from API; Solution Phase 1: Added comprehensive debug logging to handleImageEditComplete() - logs placeholder search results (searchId/foundIndex/totalItems/allIds), logs before/after update state (status/initialImage), logs localStorage save success/failure, added error logging when placeholder not found, implemented fallback to create new item if placeholder missing (prevents data loss); Solution Phase 2: Protected initialImage field in mergeHistoryItem() - detects completed image edits (outputType=image + status=completed + modelKey=ws-wan-26-image-edit), force preserves localItem.initialImage during API merge, prevents refreshHistory() from overwriting edited images with original, added protection logging "🛡️ Protected edited image for: {id}"; Testing Protocol: 4 test scenarios - normal edit completion, placeholder not found fallback, page refresh persistence, manual history refresh protection; Benefits: Immediate thumbnail update within 1 second of completion, status correctly changes to COMPLETED, no more spinner overlay after edit, edited image persists after page reload, API refresh cannot overwrite edited images, comprehensive logging for debugging future issues)',
        '💾 Grok Bulletproof Persistence v2.12.14 (CRITICAL: Zero Data Loss System - User Requirement: "Grok videos cost money - ห้ามให้ตกหล่นแม้แต่อันเดียว" - Problem: Grok videos created successfully but disappeared from history; Root Causes: 1) refreshHistory() cleared Grok videos when localStorage failed, 2) Race condition in saveToHistory(), 3) Aggressive cleanup deleted Grok first, 4) No recovery mechanism, 5) Single-point localStorage failure; Solution: 5-Layer Defense System - Layer 1: Dedicated Grok IndexedDB store (protected:true NEVER auto-delete), Layer 2: Persistent metadata store for API recovery, Layer 3: Atomic multi-layer save (IDB + metadata + localStorage, requires 2/3 success), Layer 4: Automatic recovery from IndexedDB on page load, Layer 5: Protected cleanup (ALL Grok videos preserved during quota/aggressive cleanup); Implementation: Added initGrokDB(), saveGrokVideoToIDB(), getAllGrokVideos(), saveGrokMetadata(), saveGrokVideoAtomic(), recoverGrokVideos(), migrateExistingGrokVideos(); Modified refreshHistory() to always include Grok from IDB with deduplication; Modified aggressive cleanup (line 1955) and quota cleanup (line 9329) to protect ALL Grok videos; Emergency logging stores failures to localStorage vidist_grok_failures for manual recovery; Success Criteria: Zero data loss, multi-layer storage, automatic recovery, protected from all cleanup operations)',
        '🎬 Grok Modal + Auto-Cleanup + Preload Fix v2.12.13 (THREE CRITICAL FIXES: 1) Grok videos now play in modal like Wavespeed instead of new tab - Root cause: crossOrigin="anonymous" forces CORS check, Grok has no CORS headers; Solution: Skip crossOrigin for Grok, uses opaque CORS mode; 2) Auto-cleanup was deleting ALL Grok videos on page refresh! - Root cause: auto-cleanup checked "video_url" field but system uses "url" field; Field name mismatch caused ALL successful Grok videos to be deleted; Fix: Now checks BOTH "url" (current) AND "video_url" (legacy) fields; Also added "starting" status to preserved statuses; 3) Preload CORS errors when pasting images - Root cause: preloadVideoToCache() tried to fetch ALL videos including Grok; Fix: Skip preload for Grok provider (no CORS support); Grok videos load directly in modal when clicked instead of preload; No more CORS errors in console)',
        '🚫 No Failed History Save v2.12.12 (CRITICAL FIX: Don\'t save failed generations to history at all - Previous behavior: Failed generations marked as "failed" status and kept in history; User feedback: "กรณีที่สร้างไม่สำเร็จ ต้องไม่บันทึกประวัติลงบน history สิ"; New behavior: Placeholder removed immediately when generation fails; Modified handleGenerationError() to delete placeholder instead of updating to failed status; Uses videoHistoryData.splice() to remove failed item; Saves cleaned history to localStorage immediately; Console logs: "🗑️ Removed failed placeholder from history: {id}"; Re-renders history without failed item; Combined with v2.12.11 auto-cleanup as safety net; No more stuck thumbnails from failed generations; History only shows successful generations; Cleaner user experience during development/testing)',
        '🧹 History Auto-Cleanup v2.12.11 (CRITICAL FIX: Remove invalid/failed items automatically on page load - Previous issue: Failed Grok generation attempts (during development) left "Missing URL" cards in history that could not be deleted even after F5; Root cause: loadHistoryFromLocalStorage() loaded ALL items without validation; Failed items had no video_url but were still saved to localStorage; Fix: Added auto-cleanup filter in loadHistoryFromLocalStorage(); Removes items without video_url AND not currently processing (pending/processing status preserved); Saves cleaned data back to localStorage automatically; Console logs: "🗑️ Auto-cleanup: Removing invalid item {id}" for each removed item; "✅ Auto-cleanup: Removed {count} invalid items" summary; Runs on every page load/refresh; Cleans up stuck development artifacts automatically; Processing items are preserved until completion/failure; No user action required - cleanup is transparent)',
        '💾 Model Selection Persistence v2.12.10 (QOL IMPROVEMENT: Remember last selected model after F5 refresh - Previous behavior: Model dropdown always defaulted to "Wan 2.5 I2V" on page load; New behavior: Automatically restores last selected model (Grok, Wan, Kling, etc.) from localStorage; Implementation: Added SELECTED_MODEL_KEY localStorage constant; Modified populateModelDropdown() to check localStorage.getItem() before using default; Modified selectModel() to save selection with localStorage.setItem(); Console logs show "💾 Restored model from localStorage" or "📋 Using default model"; Especially useful during development - no more manually reselecting Grok after every F5; Works across all models in dropdown; Persists indefinitely until user selects different model)',
        '📐 Grok Auto-Detect Aspect Ratio Fix v2.12.9 (CRITICAL FIX: Let Grok auto-detect aspect ratio from source image - Previous issue: Hardcoded "16:9" aspect ratio caused stretched videos when source image had different ratio; Root cause: generateVideo_Grok() had aspectRatio = "16:9" default parameter and call site passed hardcoded "16:9"; Grok API auto-detects aspect ratio from source image when aspect_ratio field is omitted; Fix: Changed default parameter to null and removed hardcoded value at call site; Now aspect_ratio is ONLY sent if explicitly provided (e.g., for T2V mode); For I2V mode: aspect_ratio omitted → Grok auto-detects from image → perfect ratio match; User discovery: Tested on x.ai console - leaving aspect_ratio as default/omitted produces correct ratio; Added console logging to show when auto-detection is used; Aspect ratio UI section remains hidden for I2V mode to prevent errors)',
        '🎉 Grok CORS SOLVED v2.12.8 (FINAL FIX: Open Grok videos in new browser tab - bypasses CORS entirely - User discovery: Direct browser navigation to Grok URLs works perfectly (no CORS restrictions); Simple implementation: window.open(videoUrl, "_blank") in loadVideoInModal(); Automatically closes modal after opening new tab; Videos now playable indefinitely from history (no expiration issues); Works across page refreshes and sessions; Zero CORS errors; No complex blob downloading needed; No server-side changes required; Wavespeed videos continue working in modal normally; Clean 3-line solution vs. complex workarounds; Test results: Options 1 & 2 failed (Grok server has NO CORS headers), Option 5A (new tab) is perfect solution)',
        '🔬 Grok CORS Two-Pronged Fix v2.12.7 (CRITICAL TESTING: Implemented both CORS fix options simultaneously - Option 1: Modified downloadGrokVideoAsBlob() to try downloading WITHOUT Authorization header first, then fallback to WITH auth if fails; Hypothesis: Grok video URLs might be public/pre-signed URLs and Authorization header causes 403 errors; Added detailed console logging to track which method succeeds; Option 2: Added crossorigin="anonymous" attribute to video element before setting src; Allows browser to request CORS headers from Grok server for anonymous playback; Both fixes work together: Option 1 improves blob download success, Option 2 enables direct video element playback; Comprehensive solution covering both fetch API and video element CORS scenarios; Awaiting user test with new video generation to verify console output)',
        '🔧 Grok URL Storage Fix v2.12.6 (CRITICAL BUGFIX: Save original URL to history instead of blob URL - Previous issue: Blob URLs saved to history expire on page refresh causing playback failures; Root cause: Generation code saved finalVideoUrl (blob) to history instead of videoUrl (original); Blob URLs are session-specific (blob:http://...) and become invalid after refresh; Solution: Always save original Grok URL to history, only use blob for immediate preview; Modified finalData.video_url to use videoUrl instead of finalVideoUrl; History now contains permanent original URLs that can be re-downloaded as blobs on demand; Combined with v2.12.5 loadVideoInModal() blob download, creates complete solution; Fresh blob download on every playback from history works correctly)',
        '🎬 Grok History Playback Fix v2.12.5 (CRITICAL BUGFIX: Fixed CORS error when playing Grok videos from history - Error: MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED (code 4) when loading from history panel; Root cause: History loads original Grok URL directly instead of blob URL causing CORS issues; Blob URLs from generation are session-specific and expire on refresh; Solution: Added provider check in loadVideoInModal() to detect Grok videos; Automatically downloads Grok videos as blob before playing from history; Added error handling with fallback to direct load if blob download fails; Grok videos now play correctly from history panel; Wavespeed videos continue streaming directly from server)',
        '✅ Grok Status Inference Fix v2.12.4 (CRITICAL BUGFIX: Grok API has NO status field - must infer from url presence - Grok returns {video: {url, duration, respect_moderation}, model} without status field; Documentation shows flat {url} but actual API uses nested structure; Implemented status inference: url exists → completed, error exists → failed, neither → processing; Removed reliance on non-existent status field; Fixed "🤖 Grok status: undefined" causing infinite retry loops; Now correctly detects when video is ready by checking videoData.url; Supports both nested (data.video.url) and flat (data.url) response formats for API compatibility)',
        '🔧 Grok Response Parsing Fix v2.12.3 (CRITICAL BUGFIX: Fixed Grok polling infinite retry loop - Root cause: Grok API returns nested response structure {video: {status, url, error}, model: "..."} but code expected flat {status, url}; status was undefined causing continuous retry attempts; Updated polling parser to check data.video object first with fallback to flat structure; Added defensive request_id extraction supporting multiple response formats (data.request_id || data.video?.request_id || data.id); Added detailed logging for video data structure debugging; Fixes "⚠️ grok Polling Error (will retry): Error" infinite loop; Now correctly detects pending/processing/completed/failed states)',
        '💰 Grok Content Filter Detection v2.12.2 (CRITICAL MONEY-SAVER: Stop polling immediately when Grok content filter detected - Grok charges for EVERY request including failed ones; Added immediate detection of "content moderation" and "rejected by" errors; Stops polling instantly to prevent wasting money on retries; Enhanced error message: "🚫 GROK CONTENT FILTER: [error] ⚠️ หยุดทันทีเพื่อป้องกันการเสียเงิน - Grok คิดเงินทุกครั้งแม้สร้างไม่สำเร็จ!"; Updated checkGrokContentFilter() with primary keywords: "content moderation", "rejected by", "content filter", "content policy"; Added to shouldStopPolling critical errors list alongside other fatal errors; No more retry loops on content violations - saves significant API costs)',
        '🔧 Grok HTTP 400 Fix v2.12.1 (CRITICAL BUGFIX: Fixed Grok video generation HTTP 400 error - Root cause: uploadImageToGrok() was returning file_id from Grok Files API, but video generation endpoint requires PUBLIC URLs; Grok Files API is for chat/RAG only, not video generation; Solution: Implemented imgbb API for image hosting to get public URLs; Added imgbb API key input field in Settings with localStorage persistence; Created uploadImageToImgbb() function that uploads base64 images and returns public URLs; Updated uploadImageToGrok() to call imgbb instead of Files API; Added validation to check both Grok and imgbb API keys before video generation; User-configurable API key for security (not hardcoded); Grok video generation now works correctly with public image URLs)',
        '🚀 Grok API Integration v2.12.0 (NEW PROVIDER: Added Grok (x.ai) alongside Wavespeed for video/image generation - grok-imagine-video: Image-to-Video with 1-15s duration, 720p/480p resolution, 7 aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, 3:4, 3:2, 2:3); grok-imagine-image: Image editing with base64 data URI support, instant response (no polling); Files API integration for image uploads (jpg/png only); Provider routing architecture (auto-detects Wavespeed vs Grok); Unified polling system supporting both providers; NO CONTENT FILTERING DOCUMENTED (NSFW-friendly potential); Grok API key management with localStorage persistence; Full Red Mode/Prompt Craft compatibility; Dedicated content filter detection for testing)',
        '🚨 MUTE Feature Critical Fix v2.11.1 (CRITICAL BUGFIX: MUTE was using separate visual-only system prompts instead of Red Mode principles - Deleted getSilentModePrompt() method entirely, Fixed system prompt selection to always use Red Mode/Creative Mode prompts, MUTE now preserves ALL Red Mode sophistication (intensity levels, 6/9/12 step progression, fluid stages, anatomical details), Only removes SOUND:/SPEECH: fields via post-processing, Prompts now maintain same structure/content with just audio fields removed)',
        '🔇 MUTE Feature v2.11.0 - Silent Visual-Only Prompts (NEW FEATURE: MUTE checkbox in Prompt Craft (Red Mode only) completely removes all audio/speech from generated prompts - Auto-disables SPEECH checkbox when enabled, Silent mode system prompts focus purely on visual elements (body language, facial expressions, movements, camera angles, lighting), Post-processing removes SOUND:/SPEECH:/Dialog: fields from AI output, Multi-language support (TH/EN/JA), localStorage persistence + history restoration, Results in completely silent, visual-only video prompts)',
        '🔄 Race Condition & Dialog Override Fix v2.10.0 (CRITICAL FIXES: 1) History Panel Race Condition - Added rendering ID counter with 2 checkpoints to prevent concurrent render overwrites, clicking new video thumbnail now opens correct video instead of previous one, no more manual refresh needed; 2) Prompt Craft Dialog Override - Fixed SPEECH field appearing when checkbox checked but empty, clarified dialogInstruction and added CRITICAL RULES emphasis, allows Wan model to generate natural audio without explicit speech)',
        '🎨 Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Edit v2.9.0 (NEW MODEL OPTION: Added Gemini "Nano Banana" alongside WAN 2.6 for image editing - Dropdown model selector with pricing display ($0.039 Gemini vs $0.035 WAN), Gemini as default selection, Synchronous API (5-15s vs 20-40s), Conditional UI (hides negative prompt/expansion for Gemini), Provider-specific routing architecture, Separate billing (Gemini via Google AI, not Wavespeed), Full history integration and auto-save support)',
        '🔧 History Panel Auto-Update Fix v2.8.14 (CRITICAL FIX: Video completion now always updates history panel automatically - added renderVideoHistory() call in fallback case when placeholder not found, ensures UI updates even after aggressive cleanup, no more manual refresh needed)',
        '🎯 Minimal Image History v2.8.13 (MAJOR CHANGE: Reduced image edit history from 10 → 2 images only (original + latest edited), F5 refresh keeps only current viewing image (1 image), Previous/Next buttons still work for 2-image navigation, Eliminates localStorage quota issues completely)',
        '🔒 localStorage Quota Data Loss Fix v2.8.12 (CRITICAL FIX: Aggressive cleanup now keeps 5 most recent history items instead of wiping everything - prevents data loss when localStorage is full, Added quota handling to image edit history with auto-reduce to 3 images, History preserved during localStorage pressure)',
        '🚫 Non-Interactive Processing Cards v2.8.11 (Removed delete button from processing cards - cards are now purely status displays, no hover interactions during video/image generation, prevents accidental cancellation, cleaner separation between active processing and completed items)',
        '🗑️ Simplified Delete Dialogs v2.8.10 (Removed redundant double confirmations - single short question "ต้องการลบรายการนี้?" with custom cyberpunk dialog, silent success (no alert after deletion), all messages in Thai, cleaner UX without interruption)',
        '✨ Box-Shadow Containment v2.8.9 (Fixed shadow/glow overflow on mobile - moved box-shadow from container to wrapper div, now contained within overflow:hidden boundary, eliminates edge artifacts around floating image on mobile)',

        '🔇 Silent Auto-Cleanup v2.8.7 (Removed storage quota alert when pasting images, aggressive auto-cleanup deletes oldest data silently, reduced videoHistory to 10 items, no user interruption during paste)',
        '🔧 Display Override Fix v2.8.6 (Fixed floating container showing when hidden - display:flex was overriding .hidden class due to ID selector specificity, now uses :not(.hidden) selector for flexbox)',
        '✨ Equal Size Scaling v2.8.5 (Both base and floating images now scale to same size 238px max, removed scale animation - only translate offset, hologram effect perfectly fits floating image, base image scales with editing-scaled class, centered flexbox layout)',
        '🔧 Positioning Fix v2.8.4 (Fixed floating container position - added inset-0 to properly overlay base image, floating image now appears at correct location with 30px right and 30px up offset)',
        '🔧 Syntax Fix v2.8.3 (Fixed duplicate const sourceImage declaration causing SyntaxError, reuses variable from line 6675)',
